# Research-Project
Surgical trainees have to learn surgical skills before undergoing real surgeries. Knot-
tying is one such process. It is a complex skill that is acquired through several hours

of training. This process requires expert supervision for continuous feedback. This
research aims to aid the assessment of the knot-tying skill with the help of modern
Computer Vision techniques.
The understanding of a scene in the given setting can be achieved by analysis of

Hand Gestures. The proposed pipeline includes Hand Detection, Hand Pose Estima-
tion and Phase Recognition techniques. Several approaches for hand detection has

been tested and compared side-by-side. It includes one-stage detectors like YOLO and

SSD; and two-stage detectors like Mask r-cnn on the knot-tying data. Several pose es-
timation techniques like Convolutional Pose Machines and Hand Keypoint Detection in

Single Images using Multiview Bootstrapping. It is followed by the gesture recognition
task.
The assessment is done on two knot-tying sequences forehand throw and backhand
throw.
